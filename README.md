Shairport-installer
===================

Install Shairport (Airplay-ish) on your Ubuntu/Mint Desktop  <br/>
Succesfully tested on MInt 16 Cinnamon and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, probably would work on VM for MS too<br/>
Guide:  <br/>
1. Download 'install-Shairport.sh' to any location on your Linux machine <br/>
2. Right-click the file and open 'Properties'  <br/>
3. Go to the "Permissions" tab and "allow executing file as a program" - close  <br/>
4. Double-click the file and type in your password and ENTER  <br/>
5. What happened: a: Some packages was installed, b: a Shairport folder was created in your Documents folder, c: a run-shairport.sh was created on your desktop  <br/>
6. Just as step 3, allow to execute as a program - close  <br/>
7. Double click the 'run_shairport.sh' on your desktop and see if you can find 'Shairport' on your iOS- or your rooted Android device :)  <br/>
