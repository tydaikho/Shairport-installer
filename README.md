Shairport-installer
===================
The 'shairport-installer.sh' script installs an Airport-like server on your Debian machine called 'Shairport' developed by 'abrasive' (Github). This means that Airplay-supported devices can airplay music through the speakers connected to your Linux machine. Examples of Airplay-supported devices: IOS-devices and rooted Android with e.g <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.airaudio">Airplay app</a>. The devices must be connected to the same network as the Linux machine to get access. Shairport solely allows for playing music. There is a video equivalent from another repository that I currently haven't tried it out.<br/>
The Shairport system should work for Fedora users as well but they need to check if the packages in the script suits their distro and find its equivalent if not.<br/>
First time you run the 'shairport-installer' script the shairport server will start automatically but when you want to start it next time you should run the 'run_shairport' script created on your desktop. 

<h3>Step by step guide to install Shairport on your Debian machine:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the 'shairport-installer.sh:<br/>
<code>cd Download<br/>
wget https://github.com/y-nut/Shairport-installer/archive/master.zip<br/>
unzip master.zip<br/>
cd Shairport-installer-master</code>

<li>Install shairport, create run_shairport.sh on desktop and run shairport first time by executing the command:<br/>
<code>sudo sh shairport-installer.sh</code></li>
<li>Now the shairport server should run in your terminal:<br/>
<code>Listening for connections.<br/>
11758</code> (new number each run)<br/>
Look for 'Shairport' on your Airplay device and play music. If it works, you can then remove the 'shairport-installer.sh' file.</li>
</ol>
